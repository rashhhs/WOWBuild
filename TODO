1. Link/Integration warcraft/wowhead tooltips (Hover feature?)
2. Warcraft logs feature
3. Prettier is not ordering test paths correctly
4. Multi Games Architecture
5. Tooltips must be prepared/configured for multi spec (like Death's Due spell). Create fields/properties for every spec could be a solution
6. Bump Builds!
