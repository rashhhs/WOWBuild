Architecture:
 - Multi Games Architecture (Lerna and find a way to encapsulate game business in a game module)

Features:
 - Warcraft logs feature
 - Tooltips must be prepared/configured for multi spec (like Death's Due spell). Create fields/properties for every spec could be a solution
 - General info build (build detail)
 - Build Fragment: Add Tooltips
 - Tooltips: Deathchill spell has 2 extraInfos (Remorseless Winter & Chain of Ice). And for now, it only be possible to have one. :)

Chore:
 - Prettier is not ordering test paths correctly
 - Bump Builds! (World of Warcraft)
